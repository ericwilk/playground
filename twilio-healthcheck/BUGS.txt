* You can't change the website through the UI and get it to monitor another one without refreshing the app. The scheduler needs to check if the previous value of website is null and reset messageSent to false..

* public void checkWebsiteIsRunning() should probably be private. I do not think public is required for @Scheduled, only a void method in a scanned class.

* TERRIBLE UI but I see no reason to spend a lot of time on that since this was just toying around.

* I do not like all the statics. I guess this really depends on the use case, but if multiple users are using this application simultaneously it could be a problem. If that were the case however, it would need to be changed to support multiple websites. That should not be too hard to implement.
