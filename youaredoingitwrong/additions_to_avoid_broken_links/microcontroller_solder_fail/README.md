Am I missing something?
==========

I sure see solder, unless they mean like.. Reballing.

Verbatim, it's "No dolder required."

Those pins aren't going to magically attach themselves and conduct (well maybe if you tolt the board at the right angle and never move it).

This makes no sense.

Just for the fun of it I had a .dia and PNG those who can't read them (there is freeware, at least w/ Linux).

This is just in case it gets compliated :V <-- (implying arcasm)

![.dia File](solder_free_with_solfer.dia "Dia moedling diagram.")
![.pdf File](solder_free_with_solfer.pdf "Dia moedling diagram.")

It explains the reference between holes with like... Solder, and the 1:1 relationship with the laws of physics.

Even though I'm sure the alloy process it fine that's still like.. soldering :V

Pretty complicated, I know.

Unless I'm missing something, in which case I want to know (but I don't think I am).
