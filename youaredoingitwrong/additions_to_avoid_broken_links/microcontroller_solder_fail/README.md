Am I missing something?
==========

I sure see solder, unless they mean like.. Reballing.

This makes no sense.

Just for the fun of it I had a .dia and PNG those who can't read them (there is freewhere I'm sure. It's free with Linux).

This is just in case it gets compliated :V <-- (implying arcasm)

![.dia File](solder_free_with_solfer.dia "Dia moedling diagram.")
![.pdf File](solder_free_with_solfer.pdf "Dia moedling diagram.")

It explains the reference between holes with likel... Solder, and the 1:1 relationship with the laws of physics.

Pretty complicated, I know :V
