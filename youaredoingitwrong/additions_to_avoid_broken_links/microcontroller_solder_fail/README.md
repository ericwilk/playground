Am I missing something?

I sure see solder, unless they mean like.. Reballing. Which is wait... Solder.

Verbatim, it's "No solder required."

Those pins aren't going to magically attach themselves and conduct (well maybe if you tilt the board at the right angle and never move it, preferably in a sealed container without tempature fluctuations that doesn't ever move and maeby gas with N2 for an inert atmosphere. You get the idea).

This makes no sense.

Just for the fun of it I had a .dia and PNG those who can't read them (there is freeware, at least w/ Linux).

This is just in case it gets compliated :V <-- (implying arcasm)

![.dia File](solder_free_with_solfer.dia "Dia moedling diagram.")
![.pdf File](solder_free_with_solfer.pdf "Dia moedling diagram.")

It explains the reference between holes with like... Solder, and the 1:1 relationship with the laws of physics.

Even though I'm sure the alloy process it fine that's still like.. soldering :V

Pretty complicated, I know.

Unless I'm missing something, in which case tell me.

Only thing I can think of is there's enough there but I've never seen that be the case.

Oh wait. That's soldering :V
